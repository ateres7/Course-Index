        ASSIGNMENT I: Confounding Tools
    </h1>

    <br>

    <p>
Using the video game file I started playing with a group of friends online over the
pandemic, I chose to use stone fences and paths that can be created in the game to
block off the quadrants, creating pseudo quarantine zones, and marking down with stone
paths morse code of a few words, questioning, calling for help, etc. The bottom right
quadrant, as the most condensed, has the most identifiable code from morse code, … - -
- …, to signify SOS as a ‘cry for help’. The torches in the final are all also in that pattern,
wherever I could fit it. Overall I went for a theme of isolation and feeling trapped in this
pandemic and in quarantine using a game that, rather ironically, actually helped a lot with
that feeling by connecting me with friends online.

        2 - Clearing the field, with a change in seasons in-game, matching the winters I
personally feel as though I skipped over the pandemic, as well as measuring how much
of the screen will be in the final cut

        7 - Final poster, same variation as before, just with the addition of my friend’s character,
        as the host, in the center of the bottom right quadrant with all the SOS repetitions,
